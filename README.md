# HAMi DRA Driver

## Overview

DRA is a Kubernetes feature that lets you request and share resources among Pods, it provides a flexible way for requesting, configuring, and sharing specialized devices like GPUs. To learn more about DRA in general, good starting points are: [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/), [Kubernetes blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/01/kubernetes-v1-33-dra-updates/).

The HAMi DRA Driver brings the support of DRA for [HAMi-Core](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi-core)(the in-container GPU resource controller), it might be the first open source DRA Driver for AMD GPU with [DRA Consumable Capacity](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-scheduling/5075-dra-consumable-capacity) feature enabled.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

The list of prerequisites for running the DRA Driver for HAMi-Core is described below
- ROCm drivers >= 6.0
- default runtime configured as rocm for containerd/docker/cri-o container runtime
  - `accept-rocm-visible-devices-as-volume-mounts` option should be set to `true` for ROCm Container Runtime
- Kubernetes version >= 1.34 with DRA Consumable Capacity feature enabled
- glibc >= 2.17 & glibc < 2.30
- kernel version >= 3.10


Please check the [DaemonSet configuration](demo/yaml/ds.yaml) in the demo/yaml directory. We are working on a Helm Chart for this DRA Driver, it will be available in the near future.
